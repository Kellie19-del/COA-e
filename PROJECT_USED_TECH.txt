Project Used Technologies (Student Notes)

This project is made with these tools and technologies:

1. HTML5
- I used HTML for all page structure.

2. Tailwind CSS (CDN)
- I used Tailwind utility classes for responsive UI and mobile app style layout.

3. JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- I wrote the frontend logic in plain JavaScript (no React/Vue).
- It handles login, dashboard updates, modals, table rendering, and API calls.

4. Node.js (Serverless API)
- Backend API is in `api/db.js`.
- It supports GET and POST for app data.

5. Supabase
- I used Supabase as cloud database.
- Data is stored in table: `public.app_state`.
- The backend connects with `@supabase/supabase-js`.

6. SQL
- I used SQL schema file (`supabase/schema.sql`) to create table and seed initial data.

7. Vercel
- Project is deployed on Vercel.
- Local dev also runs with `vercel dev`.

8. npm
- I used npm for dependency management and scripts.

9. Environment Variables
- `.env.local` is used for Supabase keys and URL.

10. Extra UI Libraries
- Remix Icon for icons.
- Google Fonts (Plus Jakarta Sans) for typography.

Short Summary:
This is a full-stack student project with static frontend + serverless Node.js API + Supabase database, deployed on Vercel.
